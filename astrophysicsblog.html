  <h1>Astrophysics</h1>

  <article>
<h2> Basic Information</h2>
 Astrophysics is the branch of space science that combines physics and astronomy to explore the universe and its celestial objects.
Astrophysicists utilize the principles of physics and chemistry to investigate the properties and 
behavior of stars, galaxies, planets, and other cosmic phenomena.
 They study the life cycles of stars, the formation of galaxies, the existence of black holes, and the origins and evolution of the universe itself.</p>

<p>Astrophysics plays a crucial role in expanding our understanding of the universe and our place within it. 
It has led to groundbreaking discoveries, such as the Big Bang theory, the existence of dark matter and dark energy,
 and the possibility of life on other planets.
 Continued research in astrophysics promises to unveil even more astonishing
 secrets about the cosmos and inspire future generations of scientists and explorers.</p>

    <h2>Branches of Astrophysics</h2>

<p>Stellar Astrophysics: This branch focuses on the study of stars,
 including their formation, evolution, internal structure, and eventual demise.
 It explores topics like stellar nucleosynthesis (how stars create heavier elements),
 stellar explosions (like supernovae),
 and the properties of different types of stars (like white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes).</p>

 <p>Galactic Astrophysics: This area investigates galaxies, their formation, evolution, and interactions. 
It delves into the distribution of stars, gas, and dark matter within galaxies, the dynamics of galactic mergers,
 and the large-scale structure of the universe.</p>

<h2> Interesting Facts About Astrophysics</h2>
<p>You're older than the Sun: The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old,
 while our Sun is "only" about 4.6 billion years old.</p>


 <p>Most of the universe is invisible: Dark matter and dark energy make up the vast majority of the universe,
 but we can't directly observe them. Their existence is inferred through their gravitational effects on visible matter.  </p>
 

 <p>A teaspoon of neutron star weighs as much as Mount Everest: Neutron stars are incredibly dense,
 packing the mass of our Sun into a sphere the size of a city.   </p>


 <p>The Milky Way galaxy is on a collision course with Andromeda: In about 4.5 billion years,
 our Milky Way galaxy will collide with the Andromeda Galaxy.   </p>


 <p>There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth: 
This gives you a sense of the sheer scale and vastness of the cosmos.</p>
